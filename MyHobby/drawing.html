        <p>It all started in my Childhood as soon as i picked up a pencil. It was my own little world. I mostly draw
            pictures of people, animals and birds. I use crayons, pencils, colour pencils etc to draw pictures. During
            birthdays of my parents and friends, i gift my best drawings to them. I got first prize in my school for the
            drawing competition. I like to draw sunset the most. </p>
